        "markdown":"We founded Parity Technologies with the aspiration to write the best and safest software we can. We’ve learned a lot from our past mistakes. The wallet bugs, in particular, lead us to research how we can make writing and deploying software as safe as possible. [Read more](https://paritytech.io/new-smart-contract-development-processes/)."

        "markdown":"We are early pioneers in a new industry where software is money, and one oversight can cost millions to the very users we work so hard to support. We started Parity Technologies in 2015 with the goal to build the fastest and most secure software for Ethereum and the decentral web. This was before there was mainstream interest in blockchain and Ethereum. We were excited to pioneer technologies that enabled others to explore these promising technologies. Attention grew rapidly and so did the value at stake — much faster than anyone had expected. [Read more](https://paritytech.io/our-commitment-to-ethereum-and-a-decentralised-future/)."

Most mobile wallets connect to the internet, but Parity Signer gives you one extra layer of security: it never connects to the internet and can be used air-gapped.

        "markdown":"[Kovan](https://github.com/kovan-testnet/proposal) is the community-driven test network that runs on the Parity [Aura](https://wiki.parity.io/Aura) proof-of-authority consensus engine.\n\nWith a consistent 4-second block time, immunity to proof-of-work spam attacks, the network allows developers to develop their applications on a reliable platform. While in an early phase, it already has proven itself to be consistent and available, with all the tools you have come to expect from a testnet ecosystem.\n\nTo learn more, read the original [press release](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/parity-pushes-new-ethereum-testnet-kovan-after-spam-attacks-1609901) or join us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/Lobby)."
