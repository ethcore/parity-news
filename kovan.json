        "markdown":"[Kovan](https://github.com/kovan-testnet/proposal) is the community-driven test network that runs on the Parity [Aura](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Aura) proof-of-authority consensus engine.\n\nWith a consistent 4-second block time, immunity to proof-of-work spam attacks, the network allows developers to develop their applications on a reliable platform. While in an early phase, it already has proven itself to be consistent and available, with all the tools you have come to expect from a testnet ecosystem.\n\nTo learn more, read the original [press release](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/parity-pushes-new-ethereum-testnet-kovan-after-spam-attacks-1609901) or join us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/Lobby)."

        "markdown":"Have questions? We would like to get them answered. The [Parity wiki](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki) should be the first stop for any general questions in running the software, configuring it or just trying out some of the basic or advanced features of Parity, either as a user, developer or miner.\n\nIf you prefer direct interaction with the team, join us on our [gitter](https://gitter.im/paritytech/parity) or [riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#parity-watercooler:matrix.org) channel and feel free to ask any questions."
