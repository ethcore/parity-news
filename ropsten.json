        "markdown":"[Parity 1.11 Beta](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/releases/tag/v1.11.1) is here: a faster, more extensible Ethereum client. This huge update to Parity Ethereum allows you to create encrypted contracts and transactions on-chain and warp-sync to specific blocks.

        "markdown":"We founded Parity Technologies with the aspiration to write the best and safest software we can. We’ve learned a lot from our past mistakes. The wallet bugs, in particular, lead us to research how we can make writing and deploying software as safe as possible. [Read more](https://paritytech.io/new-smart-contract-development-processes/)."

        "markdown":"We are early pioneers in a new industry where software is money, and one oversight can cost millions to the very users we work so hard to support. We started Parity Technologies in 2015 with the goal to build the fastest and most secure software for Ethereum and the decentral web. This was before there was mainstream interest in blockchain and Ethereum. We were excited to pioneer technologies that enabled others to explore these promising technologies. Attention grew rapidly and so did the value at stake — much faster than anyone had expected. [Read more](https://paritytech.io/our-commitment-to-ethereum-and-a-decentralised-future/)."

Most mobile wallets connect to the internet, but Parity Signer gives you one extra layer of security: it never connects to the internet and can be used air-gapped.

        "markdown":"We are pleased to [announce](https://github.com/ethereum/ropsten/blob/master/revival.md) that the Ropsten testnet has been revived! Thanks to a generous donation of GPU hashpower, the Ropsten chain has been cleared of the spam blocks that had accumulated in a [recent attack](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/12477).\n\nWhile there is a trend toward adoption of alternative [proof-of-authority](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Proof-of-Authority-Chains) consensus protocols for Ethereum testnets, such as [Kovan](https://github.com/kovan-testnet/proposal), Ropsten as a public proof-of-work Ethereum testnet remains relevant for multiple reasons.\n\nSince the Ethereum mainnet still operates based on PoW consensus, a PoW testnet best reproduces the current production environment, i.e., system and network conditions on the live Ethereum mainnet. Thus, Ropsten is useful for experiments to investigate certain issues that we observe today on the mainnet, such as the relation between uncle rates and gas prices. And for Dapp developers, Ropsten is useful for realistic tests of back-end performance (i.e., mainnet transactions and block times) and front-end user experience.

The [Parity wiki](https://wiki.parity.io) should be the first stop for any general questions in running the software, configuring it or just trying out some of the basic or advanced features of Parity, either as a user, developer or miner.\n\nIf you prefer direct interaction with the team, join us on our [gitter](https://gitter.im/paritytech/parity) or [riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#parity-watercooler:matrix.org) channel and feel free to ask any questions."
