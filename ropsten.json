Decentralised initiatives such as [Giveth](https://giveth.io/) and [Swarm.City](https://swarm.city/) have seen their projects hampered by high gas costs, forcing them to look for alternative ways to securely run their ÐApps.

        "markdown":"We are pleased to [announce](https://github.com/ethereum/ropsten/blob/master/revival.md) that the Ropsten testnet has been revived! Thanks to a generous donation of GPU hashpower, the Ropsten chain has been cleared of the spam blocks that had accumulated in a [recent attack](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/12477).\n\nWhile there is a trend toward adoption of alternative [proof-of-authority](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Proof-of-Authority-Chains) consensus protocols for Ethereum testnets, such as [Kovan](https://github.com/kovan-testnet/proposal), Ropsten as a public proof-of-work Ethereum testnet remains relevant for multiple reasons.\n\nSince the Ethereum mainnet still operates based on PoW consensus, a PoW testnet best reproduces the current production environment, i.e., system and network conditions on the live Ethereum mainnet. Thus, Ropsten is useful for experiments to investigate certain issues that we observe today on the mainnet, such as the relation between uncle rates and gas prices. And for Dapp developers, Ropsten is useful for realistic tests of back-end performance (i.e., mainnet transactions and block times) and front-end user experience.
