        "markdown":"**PICOPS** (Parity ICO Passport Service) is a new service, created and hosted by Parity Technologies which enables members of the public worldwide to associate a single Ethereum address with their unique identity; more precisely, the service offers a means to validate that the owner of an Ethereum wallet has passed an ID background check stating that they are not part of a restricted set of users (e.g., US citizen or individuals on official watchlists). Learn about [PICOPS on our blog](https://paritytech.io/blog/parity-technologies-launches-picops.html)."

The [Parity wiki](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki) should be the first stop for any general questions in running the software, configuring it or just trying out some of the basic or advanced features of Parity, either as a user, developer or miner.\n\nIf you prefer direct interaction with the team, join us on our [gitter](https://gitter.im/paritytech/parity) or [riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#parity-watercooler:matrix.org) channel and feel free to ask any questions."
